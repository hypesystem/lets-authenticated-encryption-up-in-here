# Mac-forge experiments

## Definition 4.2

$$\text{Mac-forge}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi}(n)$$:

1. A key k is generated by running $$\text{Gen}(1^n)$$.
2. The adversary $$\mathcal{A}$$ is given input $$1^n$$ and oracle access to $$\text{Mac}_k(\cdot)$$.
   The adversary eventually outputs $$(m,t)$$.
   Let $$\mathcal{Q}$$ denote the set of all queries queries that $$\mathcal{A}$$ asked its oracle.
3. $$\mathcal{A}$$ *succeeds* if and only if $$\text{Vrfy}_k(m,t) = 1$$ and $$m \nin \mathcal{Q}$$.
   In that case the output of the experiment is defined to be 1.
