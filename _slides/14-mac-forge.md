# Mac-sforge experiment

</section>
<section markdown="1">

$$\text{Mac-sforge}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi}(n)$$:

  1. A key k is generated by running $$\text{Gen}(1^n)$$.
  2. The adversary $$\mathcal{A}$$ is given input $$1^n$$ and oracle access to
     $$\text{Mac}_k(\cdot)$$. The adversary eventually outputs $$(m,t)$$. Let
     $$\mathcal{Q}$$ denote the set of all queries that $$\mathcal{A}$$ asked
     its oracle, ___along with the response___.
  3. $$\mathcal{A}$$ *succeeds* if and only if $$\text{Vrfy}_k(m,t) = 1$$ and
     $$(m,t) \notin \mathcal{Q}$$. In that case the output of the experiment is
     defined to be 1.

## Definition 4.3

A message authentication code $$\Pi = (\text{Gen}, \text{Mac}, \text{Vrfy})$$ is
strongly secure, or a strong MAC, if for all probabilistic polynomial-time
adversaries $$\mathcal{A}$$, there is a negligible function negl such that:
here is a negligible function $$\text{negl}$$ such that:
$$Pr[\text{Mac-sforge}_{\mathcal{A},\Pi}(n)=1] \leq \text{negl}(n)$$
